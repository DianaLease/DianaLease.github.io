	<p>Dear Mom & Dad, <br><br> The older I become, the more I realize how lucky I am to have the both of you as my parents. I know that no matter what happens in life, I never need to be afraid, because I have the two of you by my side. My goals and plans seem to be constantly changing, but I know I have the opportunity to pursue whatever I want because of your support and guidance. I want you to know that what motivates me most is my wish to make you both proud. You are the most amazing parents in this world, and you deserve to have the best birthdays (<em>and best entire lives</em>) ever! I'm glad we are such a close family (I love our group texts with all of the kitty pics!), and I cannot wait to enjoy a lovely brunch!<br><br>
	Love,<br>
	Diana
